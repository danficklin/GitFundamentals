# git status

The command `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the status of your repository.

Using `git status` will show you what changes are being tracked, are not being tracked, what commits need to be pushed or pulled, and so on.

It is a command that is safe to use at any time. If you want to see what is going on it is good to use `git status` in between commands until you get to know that flow better.

```
git add .
git status

git commit -m "Modified landing page"
git status

git push
git status
```
